 [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/marionlouveaux/cellviz3d.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marionlouveaux/cellviz3d)

# cellviz3d

The goal of {cellviz3d} is to propose visualisation of meshes created from the segmentation of 3D/4D microscopic images, and point clouds. In particular, it helps visualising meshes from MorphographX, in combination with [{mgx2r}](https://github.com/marionlouveaux/mgx2r), or point clouds from the MaMuT Fiji plugin, in combination with {mamut2r}. <!--[{mamut2r}](https://github.com/marionlouveaux/mamut2r)-->

## Installation

You can install the released version of {cellviz3d} from [Github](https://github.com/marionlouveaux/cellviz3d) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marionlouveaux/cellviz3d")
# With vignettes
devtools::install_github("marionlouveaux/cellviz3d", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Vignette

A vignette is available in the package if you built it during installation with `build_vignettes = TRUE`:

- `vignette("cellviz3d-mgx_meshes", package = "cellviz3d")`: how to build 3d interactive plots of meshes as issued from {mgx2r} 

## Example

The data in the example below were created with the package {mgx2r}, on the example dataset of {mgx2r}. This dataset is a timelapse recording of the development of a shoot apical meristem of the plant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} expressing a membrane marker. I took one 3D stack every 12h and have 5 timepoints in total. To know more about the example dataset of {mgx2r}, see `help.search("mgx2r-package")`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(cellviz3d)
library(plotly)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Read data
myMesh <- readRDS(system.file("extdata",
                              "mgx/mesh_meristem_full_T0.rds",
                              package = "cellviz3d"))

myCellGraph <- readRDS(system.file("extdata",
                                   "mgx/cellGraph_meristem_full_T0.rds",
                                   package = "cellviz3d"))
```

`plotlyMesh()` creates a plotly graph of type mesh 3D, with custom colors and custom hover information for a single mesh. Below, the mesh is displayed with one color and one cell label per biological cell. Cell label is visible when hovering over the cell center. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
meshCellcenter <- myCellGraph$vertices[,c("label","x", "y", "z")]

plotlyMesh(meshExample = myMesh,
           meshColors = myMesh$allColors$Col_label,
           meshCellcenter = meshCellcenter) %>%
  layout(scene = list(aspectmode = "data"))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/marionlouveaux/cellviz3d/blob/master/inst/extdata/mgx/img/p1labels.png")
```
